I am a Team Lead and Senior Backend Developer with more than a decade of professional experience. My background is primarily rooted in backend engineering, with a strong emphasis on designing systems that are reliable, maintainable, and aligned with real-world business needs.

In my current role, I lead teams on complex, high-impact projects, where I am responsible not only for technical direction but also for planning, estimation, and coordination across stakeholders. I am comfortable balancing hands-on engineering work with higher-level responsibilities such as mentoring engineers, reviewing architectural decisions, and guiding teams through delivery challenges.
